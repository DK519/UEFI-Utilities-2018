# UEFI-Utilities-2018

Various UEFI utilities built against UDK2017

Create a subdirectory immediately under UDK2017 called MyApps, populate MyApps with one or more of the utilities, fix up MyApps.dsc to build the utility or utilities.

Note these utilities have only been built and tested on an X64 platform.

See http://blog.fpmurphy.com for detailed information about the utilities.

Enjoy!
